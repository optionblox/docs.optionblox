# Governance
The OptionBlox protocol is updated and maintained using a governance token model. Users recieve OBX tokens for writing derivatives. OBX tokens can be used to vote on protocol changes and updates using the OptionBlox Governance Turing Signing Server smart contract. 

## Distribution
OBX tokens are distributed to users when the derivatives they have written expire or are exercised. The amount of governance tokens that are distributed depends on the value of options that were written and the amount of time they were outstanding. In the initial version of the protocol OBX token distribution will be limited to options for certain asset pairings. 

## Governance Proposals
Governance proposals can be created by any account holding more than .1% of outstanding OBX tokens. Creating a proposal generates a governance transaction and a proposal account controlled by the governance contract. The proposal account stores the proposed governance transaction hash in an account data entry and stores the proposal status (either voting, approved, or denied) in another account data entry.

## Voting
Users have three days to vote on proposals. They vote by adding a trustline for the asset YES:proposalAccount or NO:proposalAccount depending on whether theyâ€™re voting yes or no for the proposal. At the end of the voting period votes are tallied by getting all accounts with YES or NO trustlines and recording the number of OBX tokens held by each account. If the vote passes (60% of votes are YES) the proposal status data entry will be changed to approved, if it does not pass the entry will be changed to denied. A proposal vote must reach a quorum of 5% of outstanding governance tokens in order to pass.

## Proposal Implementation
After a proposal passes there is a 2 day delay, then proposals are implemented by signing the transaction hash in the proposal account data entry and deleting the proposal account.
