# OptionBlox's Offering

OptionBlox improves the financial derivatives ecosystem by using Stellar-based derivatives to increase ecosystem efficiency, accessibility, and flexibility. Turing Signing Server smart contracts power the OptionBlox protocol, ensuring the protocol remains secure, decentralized, and efficient. Combining the efficiencies of Stellar and decentralized smart contracts creates the four pillars of OptionBlox's offering:

## OptionBlox Pillar 1: Efficiency  
The incumbent derivatives market suffers from a large amount of friction. It requires market intermediaries to provide access to the market, facilitate trades, and lower counterparty risk. These additional parties cause inefficiencies, which creates costs that get passed on to investors. By processing derivatives on Stellar, OptionBlox eliminates the need for market intermediaries. 
 
A research paper that covered Stellar-based financial derivatives measured the monetary impact of their efficiency improvements. The paper delved into efficiency gains in both transaction processing and data accessibility. Data accessibility is a huge source of cost and inefficiency in the traditional derivatives ecosystem. Additionally, the paper measured costs associated with Ethereum based financial derivatives to demonstrate Stellar’s efficiency advantage in the DeFi ecosystem. The tables below show the results of the research paper.\

## OptionBlox Pillar 2: Flexibility  
OptionBlox provides unparalleled flexibility, allowing users to accomplish any derivative use case. If OptionBlox’s standardized derivatives do not meet users' needs, Optionblox enables them to write OTC derivatives with custom contract specifications. Additionally, derivatives written with OptionBlox use Stellar’s [Anchor](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html) system to manage a contract's underlying assets. Since the Anchor system supports any asset, our contracts also support any asset.
 
- *Tokenized Derivatives*:  
OptionBlox also uses the Anchor system to tokenize derivative contracts. Tokenization allows our derivatives to be traded on any cryptocurrency exchange and stored anywhere. It also serves to decentralize OptionBlox further. In addition to improving trading and storage flexibility, tokenization allows users to write partial derivatives. If a user wants to write an ETH option but cannot provide the entire 1 ETH underlying, our partial derivative capability allows them to provide us with a fraction of 1 ETH as their contracts underlying and receive a proportional fraction of an ETH option token.

## OptionBlox Pillar 3: Accessibility
OptionBlox uses Stellar to make considerable improvements in derivative ecosystem accessibility. The decentralized nature of our system means OptionBlox is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This is a substantial improvement over the derivative ecosystem's current state, where only a small portion of the world has efficient ecosystem access. The traditional derivative ecosystem’s dependence on central parties makes it impossible for it to serve a broader market. Since OptionBlox uses Stellar to facilitate derivatives instead of central parties, it does not suffer from these limitations and can provide an open-access ecosystem. 
 
## OptionBlox Pillar 4: Useability
We’re building OptionBlox for users of all types, from experienced traders to new users in developing countries. As such, UI/UX excellence is paramount for us. However, financial inclusion doesn’t just mean throwing an app at someone in a developing country, and having them figure it out. Education is crucial to truly working towards financial inclusion. Our approach to a user-friendly interface not only involves simple and sleek controls, but also focuses on educating our users about financial derivatives.

## The Problems OptionBlox Solves:
OptionBlox was created with the intention of tackling two main directives, providing equitable access to financial systems, and driving innovation in a stagnant derivatives industry.

#### Providing Equitable Access to Financial Derivative Markets
Decentralized Ledger Technology enables the disruption of the traditional financial ecosystem that suffers from inefficiency and fails to serve so much of the world. In traditional financial markets, wealth comes with better market access and cheaper pricing. Financial derivative markets are especially prone to this effect; a study published by the IMF showed that more sophisticated parties receive significantly better prices in derivative markets. With OptionBlox, we strive to even the playing field. Whether users are hedge funds or farmers in Venezuela, OptionBlox will enable them to utilize any derivative and give them holistic access to global derivatives markets.\
 \
Equitable access to efficient derivative markets is crucial to attaining global economic equality and fostering global economic growth. A study published in the Journal of Risk and Financial management demonstrated this. The study found that financial derivatives serve as hedging tools for businesses and help drive market efficiency. We hope that by creating equitable access to financial derivatives, OptionBlox can help foster economic growth across the globe.

#### Disrupting the Incumbent Derivative Ecosystem
The current derivative ecosystem is inefficient. Writing and executing contracts costs 1000X more than what is technologically possible. The incumbent ecosystem is held back by contract intermediaries that add unnecessary friction. In the incumbent ecosystem, a single derivative contract involves not only the contract parties, but also a derivatives exchange, a central clearing party, and a derivatives broker. These contract intermediaries exist to lower counterparty risk and match buyers and sellers. OptionBlox uses Stellar to accomplish these directives, removing the need for intermediaries. This significantly lowers ecosystem costs and increases efficiency. 


Despite the current ecosystem’s inefficiency, volume in options has been increasing in retail spaces like on Robinhood and other platforms, showing the increasing demand for derivative products. We expect these numbers to continue increasing due to expanding market accessibility, of which OptionBlox will be at the forefront. OptionBlox will compete in the current market with higher efficiency and capture the expanding market with improved accessibility. Overall, OptionBlox drives necessary innovation in the derivatives ecosystem. It improves accessibility and flexibility by bringing efficiency in line with what is technologically possible to meet the needs of an expanding derivatives market.
