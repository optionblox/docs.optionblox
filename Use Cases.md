## 1. Crypto Options

#### The Problem 
Ethan wants to invest in XLM but only be exposed to the upside of the position.

#### The Solution
Ethan purchases XLM call option contracts written with OptionBlox. Until they expire, the contracts give Ethan the option to purchase XLM at a set strike price, meaning he only has exposure to XLM’s price increases. 

#### Implementation
Ethan purchases the option from the writer of the contract using any exchange. If he chooses to execute the option, he can do so at any time using OptionBlox.

Additionally, the option writer will not include the cost of transaction fees in the price they charge for their option.

#### Accessibility
OptionBlox contracts can be written by anyone and traded on any centralized or decentralized exchange. This allows Ethan to buy from a large number of different writers, allowing him to purchase his option contract at a better price.

#### Flexibility

## 2. Equity Options

#### The Problem 
Latera is an equity investor who owns 150 THUMB shares. He believes in THUMB and wants to continue holding his investment. However, he’s worried about his THUMB shares losing value in the short term. 

#### The Solution
Latera uses his THUMB shares as collateral to write and sell 1.5 THUMB call options using OptionBlox. The proceeds from this sale bolster his investment returns, softening the blow if THUMB shares either lose value in the short term or remain stagnant.

#### Implementation
Latera uses an equity anchor in the Stellar ecosystem to tokenize his shares. He then uses OptionBlox to write his call option contracts, using his tokenized shares as collateral.

## 3. OTC Futures

#### The Problem 
Adam’s manufacturing business receives revenue in USD and pays expenses in Vietnamese Dong(VND). This creates exchange rate fluctuation risk that Adam wants to hedge against. 

#### The Solution
Using OptionBlox, Adam enters into an OTC USD:VND future contract with a western bank. The future locks in the current exchange rate for the duration of the contract, protecting Adam’s business from exchange rate fluctuations.

#### Implementation
Adam uses OptionBlox to enter the USD side of the future, using a USD anchored token to provide collateral. When the future expires he will use OptionBlox to settle the future and enter a new one if he chooses to continue hedging against rate fluctuations.

## 4. OTC Swaps

#### The Problem 
Xiao’s manufacturing business is required to use carbon credits to govern their emissions. Xiao’s business is planning an expansion that will require them to increase emissions for a period, and hold more carbon credits during that period as a result. Xiao is concerned about the market price of carbon credits falling during that period.

#### The Solution
Xiao uses OptionBlox to enter into a Carbon-Credit:EUR swap. This contract will allow Xiao to purchase carbon credits from the counterparty at the beginning of the swap, then sell the credits back to the counterparty at the end of the swap for the purchase price. 

#### Implementation
Xiao uses OptionBlox to enter the EUR side of the swap, using a EUR anchored token and a Carbon Credit anchored token to represent the underlying assets. She will use OptionBlox to carry out the initiation and expiration transactions associated with the swap.
