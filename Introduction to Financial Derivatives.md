# Overview of Financial Derivatives
Here we will provide a brief overview of financial derivatives for those who may not be familiar with them. A financial derivative is a financial contract between two parties. Its value is based on an agreed-upon asset or a set of assets called the underlying assets. The most common forms of financial derivatives are futures, options, forwards, and swaps.
#### Futures
Futures are contracts between two parties to buy/sell an agreed-upon quantity of an asset, called the underlying asset, for a set price at an established future time. Common uses of futures are to hedge against price movement by the underlying asset, increase leverage, and gain exposure to rates.\

**Sample Futures Use Case Supported by OptionBlox:**
1. *Hedging*\
A gold miner knows that they will be selling 6000 kilos of gold in 6 months. 1 kilo of gold is currently worth $1000. The miner does not want to risk gold prices falling in the next 6 months, so they enter a futures contract to sell 6000 kilos of gold for $6,000,000 in 6 months. This “locks in” the current price of gold for them and allows them to continue their operations without any risk of prices falling.

#### Options
Options are contracts between two parties, a writer and a buyer. The contract gives the buyer the option, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at an agreed-upon price until the option expires. If the buyer decides to exercise this right, the option writer will fulfill the buyer's purchase or sale. Options can be either puts or calls. A call option allows its owner to buy the underlying asset at the agreed-upon "strike price." A put option allows its owner to sell the underlying asset at the strike price. Common uses of options are hedging, increasing leverage, and income generation.\

**Sample Options Use Cases Supported by OptionBlox:**
1. *Investing*\
Adam wants to invest in 1000 XLM but doesn't want to hold the XLM; he only wants to be exposed to the position's upside. Using a decentralized exchange, he purchases a XLM call option contract with a strike price of $100. Until it expires, the contract gives Adam the option to purchase 1000 XLM for $100. If the price of XLM increases to $0.20, he can exercise his option contract and purchase 1000 XLM for $100. Since, based on the new market price of $0.20, 1000 XLM is worth $200, he will receive the same returns he would receive if he had originally purchased 1000 XLM at $0.10. Thus, purchasing the contract allows Adam to gain exposure to the upside of investing in 1000 XLM without having to purchase and hold the cryptocurrency.
2. *Hedging*\
Latera holds several THUMB LLC shares but is concerned about share price volatility. To mitigate volatility risk, he decides to purchase a put option contract, guaranteeing him the option to sell 100 THUMB shares for $10,000 ($100/share) until the contract expires in 1 year. This contract protects him from any potential decline in the market value of THUMB LLC.
3. *Passive Income Generation*\
Carlos owns 1 BTC and plans to hold it until it reaches his price target of $60,000. However, he would like to earn some passive income with his invested capital. He sells a Bitcoin call contract with a strike price of $100,000 for $100. This strategy allows him to continue to hold his Bitcoin until it hits his price target while earning additional capital with his investment. Even better, the contract is only valid until it expires. If it is not exercised and expires, he can sell another call contract using his Bitcoin holdings as the underlying asset. 

#### Forwards  
Forwards are similar to futures. The main difference is that they are not settled until the expiration date. They are typically highly specified to the involved parties' needs.

#### Swaps
Swaps are similar to forwards. The difference is that instead of one exchange of assets at the expiration date, the parties swap assets twice. Once at the beginning of the contract and once at the end. These exchanges are referred to as the "near leg" and the "far leg". Like forwards, these contracts are typically highly specified to the involved parties' needs.
